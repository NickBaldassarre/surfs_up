# An Analysis of Temperature in Oahu
## Overview
### I analyzed temperture data from Oahu from the months of December and June in order to determine if an ice cream business could be sustainable all year.
## Results

* The average temperature in Oahu was roughly 4 degrees less in December than in June
* The minimum temperature in December was 8 degrees less than the minimum temperature in June
* The standard deviation in December was half a degree more than in June

## Summary

Overall, the data is promising! While the minimum temperature in December in Oahu was a little chilly for ice cream, the average was still warm at 71 degrees. Moreover, with a maximum termperature of 83 degrees, December can still provide the warm days that June can. Based on temperature alone, it would seem that an ice cream business would be sustainable all year round. One additional query that I would recommend would retrieve the number of days without percipitation in June and December order to gauge how many sunny days there are in each month. Another helpful query would involve identifying the station at the lowest elevation, as a beachside business would be at sea level. Once we have identified the station, we can utilize all of the same queries from above with a filter on that station. With any luck, we'll be slinging scoops in no time!
